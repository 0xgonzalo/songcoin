# SongCoin Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the SongCoin project with all necessary API keys and environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- A crypto wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Base mainnet ETH for gas fees

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

### Required: Pinata Configuration

Pinata is used for IPFS storage of audio files, cover art, and metadata.

1. Go to [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys)
2. Create an account and generate API keys
3. Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_token_here
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key_here
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key_here
```

### Required: Neynar Configuration

Neynar provides Farcaster API access for social features.

1. Go to [Neynar](https://dev.neynar.com/)
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_api_key_here
```

### Required: Base RPC Configuration

For blockchain interactions on Base mainnet.

```env
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
```

Alternative RPC providers (choose one):
- **Alchemy**: `https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your_api_key`
- **Infura**: `https://base-mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_project_id`
- **QuickNode**: Your QuickNode Base endpoint

### Required: Application URLs

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRAME_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

For production, replace with your actual domain.

### Optional: Wallet Connect

For enhanced wallet connection experience:

1. Go to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
2. Create a project and get your Project ID
3. Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_wallet_connect_project_id_here
```

### Optional: Farcaster Integration

For advanced Farcaster features:

```env
FARCASTER_DEVELOPER_FID=your_farcaster_developer_fid_here
FARCASTER_DEVELOPER_MNEMONIC=your_farcaster_developer_mnemonic_here
```

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Create your `.env.local` file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your API keys
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser**

## Smart Contract Addresses

The project uses these smart contracts on Base mainnet:

- **Zora Factory**: `0x777777751622c0d3258f214F9DF38E35BF45baF3`
- **Platform Referrer**: `0x79166ff20D3C3276b42eCE079a50C30b603167a6`

These are already configured in the codebase.

## Getting Test ETH

For testing on Base mainnet, you'll need ETH:

1. **Bridge ETH to Base:**
   - Use [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org/)
   - Bridge ETH from Ethereum mainnet to Base

2. **Buy ETH on Base:**
   - Use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) (Base's parent company)
   - Use any exchange that supports Base withdrawals

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pinata Upload Failures:**
   - Check your API keys are correct
   - Ensure you have sufficient Pinata storage quota
   - Verify file sizes are within limits (50MB audio, 10MB images)

2. **Blockchain Connection Issues:**
   - Ensure your wallet is connected to Base mainnet
   - Check you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
   - Verify RPC URL is accessible

3. **Metadata Loading Problems:**
   - IPFS can be slow - wait a few minutes after upload
   - Try refreshing the page or clearing cache
   - Check browser console for specific error messages

### Getting Help

- Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues)
- Review the browser console for error messages
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set

## Security Notes

- **Never commit `.env.local`** to version control
- **Keep API keys secure** and rotate them regularly
- **Use testnet first** before deploying to mainnet with real funds
- **Backup your wallet** mnemonic phrase securely

## Production Deployment

For production deployment on Vercel:

1. Add all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production domain
3. Configure custom domain and SSL
4. Enable Vercel Analytics (optional)
5. Set up monitoring and error tracking

## Next Steps
